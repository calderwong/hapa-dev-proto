## Entry 4 – Multi-provider chat (OpenAI + Gemini) & audio modes
**Prompt:** "Please review and cultivate the OpenAI API documentation, then create a reference doc and a development plan to (1) enable a user to add their OpenAI API key in addition to their Google Gemini Key, (2) be able to select OpenAI models in the chat interface, (3) be able to select between OpenAI and Google family of models in the selector, and make it so the chat interface supports all media and message types in the appropriate format for each API/model/protocol. Then start implementing."

**Summary of actions:**
- Extended shared Electron/renderer types to support OpenAI keys, model listing, chat IPC, and admin audio settings.
- Updated Electron main process to store an OpenAI key, list OpenAI models, handle `chat-with-openai` including image + audio attachments with transcription via Whisper, and persist an admin `audioMode` setting.
- Updated the preload bridge to expose `listOpenAIModels`, `chatWithOpenAI`, and admin settings IPC.
- Updated the React Settings page to manage both Gemini and OpenAI keys.
- Updated the Chat UI to support provider selection (Gemini/OpenAI), model selection per provider, multi-modal attachments, and routing chat requests to the correct IPC channel.

## Entry 5 – Streaming UX & Realtime mode stub
**Prompt:** "Can you research both Google and OpenAI APIs, and then enable both offerings to toggle between 'Real Time / Streaming' input with mic and camera OR request/response? Also fix the OpenAI streaming duplication issue."

**Summary of actions:**
- Refactored Electron chat handlers for Gemini and OpenAI to use streaming APIs and emit incremental chunks over an IPC `chat-stream` channel.
- Implemented robust SSE parsing and delta computation for OpenAI streaming to avoid duplicated text when models resend the full buffer.
- Wired the renderer Chat page to create a placeholder assistant message and append streamed deltas in real time, with a stop/cancel control tied to the active request.
- Added a UI-level "Request/Response vs Realtime" mode toggle and basic mic/camera capture that feeds attachments into the existing pipeline (backend still request/response with streaming output).

**Summary of actions:**
- Designed a local provider architecture where a llama.cpp `llama-server` instance exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` API.
- Extended Electron main to add `list-llama-models` and `chat-with-llama` IPC handlers, sharing the existing OpenAI streaming parser for incremental deltas.
- Added persistent llama runtime settings (server path, models directory, default model, port, auto-start) and process lifecycle helpers to start/stop the server and report status.
- Implemented a new `LocalLlama` React page with runtime status, configuration form, a GGUF model downloader (from URLs into the models directory), and a local models registry (list/set-default/delete).

**Implementation:**
1. **VeoOptionsPanel.tsx**:
   - Added `dragOverTarget` state for visual feedback
   - Added `handleDragOver`, `handleDragLeave`, `handleDrop` handlers
   - Drop handler parses JSON card data OR reads from file system
   - Visual feedback: cyan glow on start frame, pink glow on end frame
   - "Drop Here!" text and file-download icon when hovering

2. **CardLibrary.tsx**:
   - Enhanced `handleDragStart` to set `application/json` data
   - Includes: cardId, name, mediaKind, mediaLocalPath, thumbnail, image data

3. **Chat.tsx**:
   - Added `isDraggingFrame` and `frameDropTarget` state
   - Global drag event listeners detect when cards are being dragged
   - Auto-expands Veo options panel when dragging over chat (if Veo model selected)

**UX Flow:**
1. User drags image card from Card Library
2. Chat detects drag, auto-opens Veo options panel
3. User drops on Start Frame or End Frame slot
4. Frame is loaded and ready for video generation

## Entry 27 – Chat Media Sidebar Gallery
**Prompt:** "Can you create a feature that keeps thumbnails of all of the media created in a given chat thread, maybe as column on the side, that allows a user to click to open up their card details, but ALSO drag and drop them into media buckets like start and end frame in specific widgets like the veo video options."

**Summary of actions:**
- Created collapsible media sidebar in Chat view
- Aggregates all media from current thread (videos, extracted frames, attachments)
- All image items are draggable to Veo frame slots
- Click to navigate to Card Library

**Implementation:**
1. **ThreadMediaItem type & useMemo**:
   - Computes all media from messages: generated videos, extracted frames, image attachments
   - Each item has: id, type (video/image/audio), source (generated/extracted/attachment), dataUrl, label

2. **Media Sidebar Component** (embedded in Chat.tsx):
   - Collapsible sidebar on right side (w-48 expanded, w-10 collapsed)
   - Toggle button with chevron icon
   - Shows media count in header

3. **Expanded State**:
   - Full thumbnails with labels
   - Hover overlay shows grab icon (for images) or open-in-new (for videos/audio)
   - Type badge in corner (purple=video, cyan=audio, green=image)
   - Source label (generated/extracted/attachment)

4. **Collapsed State**:
   - Compact 8x8 thumbnail grid
   - Shows first 10 items + count badge for overflow

5. **Drag Support**:
   - Images emit `application/json` with card data
   - Compatible with VeoOptionsPanel drop zones
   - `cursor-grab` / `cursor-grabbing` states

**Layout Change:**

## Entry 33 – Imagen Config Cards: Saved Prompts & Templates
**Prompt:** "Add ability to save negative prompts and full templates as cards in the library for easy reuse."

**Design Thinking:**

The goal is to build a "config card" system where users can:
1. Save frequently-used negative prompts to their Card Library
2. Save complete template configurations for one-click reuse
3. Easily swap between saved configurations

**Card Schema Design:**

### Negative Prompt Card
```typescript
{
  type: 'config',
  subType: 'negative-prompt',
  cardId: 'neg-prompt-1733123456789',
  coreName: 'card-neg-prompt-...',
  content: 'blurry, low quality, distorted...',
  name: 'blurry, low quality, dist...',  // Truncated for display
  createdAt: '2024-12-02T...'
}
```

### Template Card
```typescript
{
  type: 'config',
  subType: 'imagen-template',
  cardId: 'imagen-template-1733123456789',
  coreName: 'card-imagen-template-...',
  name: 'High Quality Portrait',
  config: {
    aspectRatio: '3:4',
    imageSize: '2K',
    numberOfImages: 4,
    personGeneration: 'allow_adult',
    negativePrompt: 'blurry...',
    outputMimeType: 'image/png'
  },
  createdAt: '2024-12-02T...'
}
```

**Implementation:**

1. **Added Card Types**: `NegativePromptCard`, `ImagenTemplateCard` interfaces
2. **Load from Library**: On mount, reads card-library core and filters by `subType`

## Entry 18: Enhanced Message Cards with Generated Media Thumbnails & Drag-Drop
**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Prompt:** "when response messages are saved as cards and added to the right sidebar, can you also save/attach the returned media and show its thumbnail + make drag and dropping the image in the message saved as a card and on the sidebar work drag and drop like the other types that have images."

### Execution Summary:

**Problem:** When saving AI responses (e.g., from Nano Banana image generation) as message cards, the generated images embedded in the response content were not being extracted, saved, or displayed as thumbnails. The sidebar showed text previews instead of image thumbnails, and drag-drop didn't work the same as the library picker.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Extract Embedded Images from Markdown Content** (`Chat.tsx`)
   - Added `extractEmbeddedImages()` helper to parse `![image](data:image/...;base64,...)` patterns
   - Extracts dataUrl and mimeType from generated images in AI responses

2. **Updated `createMessageCard` Function**
   - Now extracts embedded images and stores them in `generatedImages` field
   - Uses first embedded image as thumbnail if no attachments exist
   - Adds `generatedImageCount` to library entry metadata

3. **Updated Save Handler**
   - Also extracts embedded images when setting thumbnail in `messageCardState`

4. **Enhanced Sidebar Display**
   - Message cards with image thumbnails now show the **actual image** instead of text preview
   - Added "CARD" badge and role indicator overlay on image
   - Falls back to text preview if no image available

5. **Fixed Drag & Drop to Work Like Library Picker** (`ChatInput.tsx`)
   - Updated drop handler to check for `application/json` data (image cards)
   - Extracts image dataUrl and creates proper `Attachment` with `fromCard` metadata
   - Now adds to `attachments` array, not just `attachedMessageCards`

6. **Fixed Stutter During Drag**
   - Removed state updates from `handleWindowDragOver` (was causing rapid re-renders)
   - State now only set on `dragenter` and cleared on `dragleave`
   - Added `application/json` type detection for image cards

**Visual Result:**
```
Sidebar Card (with image):
┌────────────────┐
│ [Generated Img]│  ← Shows actual image thumbnail
│ ───────────────│
│ CARD    💜     │  ← Badge + role indicator
│    Response    │
└────────────────┘

Drag flow:
Sidebar Card → Drag → Drop on Input → Attachment locked in (like library picker)
```

**Files modified:**
- `src/pages/Chat.tsx` (extractEmbeddedImages, createMessageCard, sidebar display, drag handling)
- `src/components/ChatInput.tsx` (drop handler, drag state management)

## Entry 19 – Pet Card System & Header Pet Portal
**Prompt:** "Starting by when a new pet is created, I want you to save it as a new Card with a type <pet> with its animations and their configurations and behavior. Create a new 'pet area' in the header..."

**Summary of actions:**
Created a comprehensive Pet Card system that transforms pets into card-based entities, enabling:
1. Pets as persistent Cards stored in Hypercore
2. A header "Pet Portal" where pets can roam
3. Drag-drop between Sanctuary and Header to change pet "location state"

**Design Document Created:**
`docs/PET_CARD_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Complete architecture spec covering:
- PetCard schema with animations, behaviors, location state
- Card relationships for future agent composition
- Environment themes for the portal
- State machine for pet locations (sanctuary ↔ header ↔ hidden)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Extended Pet Types** (`src/components/pets/types.ts`)
   - Added `PetCard` interface with full card schema
   - Added `PetLocation`, `PetZone`, `PetDragData` types
   - Added `PetCardIndexEntry` for card-library integration
   - Added `EnvironmentTheme` for portal backgrounds

2. **Created Pet Card Utilities** (`src/utils/petCardUtils.ts`)
   - `createPetCard()` - Create & persist pet as card
   - `loadPetsByZone()` - Load pets by location
   - `updatePetLocation()` - Change pet zone state
   - `petCardToConfig()` / `petConfigToCard()` - Conversion utilities
   - Drag data helpers for pet-specific MIME types

3. **Pet Portal Component** (`src/components/pets/PetPortal.tsx`)
   - Self-contained mini habitat in header (200px × 40px)
   - Embedded `HeaderPetController` for scaled-down behavior
   - Environment themes (Meadow, Night, Cyber, Space, Sunset)
   - Drop zone with visual feedback
   - Click to cycle themes
   - Pets scale to 28px with 5fps update rate

4. **Updated Layout** (`src/components/Layout.tsx`)
   - Integrated PetPortal into rux-global-status-bar
   - Positioned between logo and system indicators

5. **Enhanced Sanctuary** (`src/pages/Pets.tsx`)
   - Loads pets from card library on mount
   - All pet creation now saves as proper cards
   - Drop zone for pets returning from header
   - Draggable pets (when card exists)
   - Empty state and loading state UI

6. **Enhanced Pet Component** (`src/components/pets/Pet.tsx`)
   - Added `draggable` and `onDragStart` props
   - Visual drag indicator (purple dot)
   - Cursor changes for drag feedback

**Visual Architecture:**

## Entry 20 – Pet Behavior System & Physics Engine
**Prompt:** "Make pet behavior in the header more sophisticated to respond to different types of environments... think about scaffolding design and how to update the intelligence and behavior..."

**Summary of actions:**
Refactored the Pet Portal to use a sophisticated "Brain + Body" architecture, enabling physics-based movement and environment-aware behaviors.

**Design Document Created:**
`docs/PET_BEHAVIOR_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Outlines the separation of decision making (Brain) from execution (Physics/Body).

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Physics System (`types.ts`, `petCardUtils.ts`)**
    - Added `EnvironmentPhysics` interface:
      - `gravity`: Controls Y-axis pull (allows space floating)
      - `friction`: Controls X-axis deceleration (allows slippery surfaces)
      - `verticality`: Boolean for whether pets can fly/float
      - `bounciness`: Wall restitution
    - Updated all `ENVIRONMENT_THEMES` with specific physics profiles.

2.  **Behavior Engine (`HeaderPetController.ts`)**
    - **The Brain (`PetBehaviorEngine`)**: 
      - Uses a weighted random system for state transitions.
      - Modifies weights based on "Personality" (derived from speed) and Environment.
      - Example: "Energetic" pets run more; "Space" environment encourages idling/floating.
    - **The Body (`HeaderPetController`)**:
      - Implements a physics loop separate from the state machine.
      - Handles velocity, acceleration, gravity, and collision detection.
      - "Soft" wall collisions (turn around or bounce) instead of hard resets.
      - Smooth 30fps update loop for fluid animation.

3.  **Component Integration (`PetPortal.tsx`)**
    - Replaced inline controller with the new class.
    - Updated `MiniPet` renderer to handle Y-axis positioning (jumping/floating).
    - Connected theme changes to the physics engine instantly.

**Outcome:**
Pets now behave differently depending on the theme:
- **Meadow**: Walk/Run normally.
- **Space**: Float around with low gravity, bouncing off walls.
- **Cyber**: Heavy gravity, sticky movement.
- **Night**: Slightly slippery.

## Entry 21 – Pet Card System Fixes & Refinements
**Prompt:** "Fix drag-and-drop transfer issues and missing pet cards in the library."

**Summary of actions:**
Addressed two critical issues preventing the Pet Card System from functioning correctly:
1.  **Card Library Visibility**: Pets were missing from the library because the index parser wasn't copying the `mediaKind` field.
2.  **Drag-and-Drop Persistence**: Transferring pets resulted in duplicate "ghost" pets or failures because the loader wasn't deduplicating index entries (loading both old 'sanctuary' and new 'header' states).

**Fixes Implemented:**
- **`src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx`**: Updated `loadCards` to correctly propagate `mediaKind` from the index entry, ensuring pets are classified as 'pet' instead of 'text'.
- **`src/utils/petCardUtils.ts`**: Added deduplication logic to `loadPetCards`. It now maps entries by `cardId` and keeps only the latest version, ensuring a pet only exists in its most recent zone.
- **`src/pages/Pets.tsx`**: Implemented `onDragEnd` handler to reload the sanctuary view immediately after a successful drop (`dropEffect === 'move'`), removing the transferred pet from the main view.
- **`src/components/pets/Pet.tsx`**: Exposed `onDragEnd` prop to the draggable element.

**Outcome:**
- Pets created now appear correctly in the Card Library.
- Dragging a pet from Sanctuary to Header correctly moves it (disappears from Sanctuary, appears in Header).
- No more duplicate pets appearing in both zones simultaneously.

## Entry 22 – Card Library Pet Visibility Fix
**Prompt:** "I still don't see any pet type cards in the library."

**Summary of actions:**
Fixed a regression in `CardLibrary.tsx` where `enrichWithCardRecords` was inadvertently overwriting the `mediaKind` property with `undefined` for pet cards, causing them to fall back to 'text' type and often be filtered out or mis-rendered.

**Fixes Implemented:**
- **`src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx`**: 
  - Updated `loadCards` to propagate `mediaKind` from the index.
  - Updated `enrichWithCardRecords` to initialize `mediaKind` from the existing entry (instead of undefined) and added an explicit check for `cardRecord.type === 'pet'`.

**Outcome:**
Pets should now be correctly identified, filtered, and displayed in the Card Library.

## Entry 24 – Pet Drag & Drop Fixes (Library & Sanctuary)
**Prompt:** "dropping from either card library or sanctuary into the pet zone doesn't work anymore" followed by "dropping from the sanctuary works now. But dragging and dropping a pet card from the library still does not work."

**Summary of actions:**
- **Problem Analysis:**
    - Drag and drop from Sanctuary and Card Library to the Header Pet Portal was failing.
    - Root cause 1: `parsePetDragData` utility was too strict, only looking for specific `pet-card` structure and missing generic `card-transfer` payloads.
    - Root cause 2: `CardLibrary` drag handler was stripping essential pet data (contained in `cardRecord`) from the drag payload, preventing the portal from reconstructing the `PetCard`.

- **Implementation:**
    - **`src/utils/petCardUtils.ts`**: Updated `parsePetDragData` to handle generic `card-transfer` payloads. Added logic to reconstruct a valid `PetCard` from `CardIndexEntry` + `cardRecord` data if the specialized `pet-card` format is missing.
    - **`src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx`**: Updated `handleDragStart` to explicitly include the full `cardRecord` object and `type: 'card-transfer'` in the `application/json` drag data.

- **Outcome:**
    - Validated that dragging pets from both the Sanctuary (specialized view) and Card Library (generic grid) now correctly populates the Pet Portal.

**Summary of actions:**

### Pipeline UI Redesign
- Added visual phase progress bar in header (LEO → THOR → MEDIA → MINT)
- Updated THOR_MEDIA_PENDING with clearer "Card Forging Complete" banner and "Generate Card Artwork" button
- Updated THOR_REVIEW with "Artwork Generation Complete" banner and "Mint Cards to Vault" button
- Added skip options (pipelineSkipMedia, pipelineSkipFailed)
- Fixed "View in Library" button navigation (was pointing to wrong route)
- Added set name display on completion screen

### Card Sets Feature (Full Implementation)
**Design Document:** docs/card_sets_feature_design.md

**Backend:**
- Created CardSet and MergedSet TypeScript interfaces (src/types/cardSet.ts)
- Added IPC handlers in main.ts:
  - card-sets:list - Get all card sets
  - card-sets:get - Get specific set by ID
  - card-sets:create - Create new set
  - card-sets:create-merged - Create merged set from multiple sets
  - card-sets:get-card-ids - Resolve set to card IDs (handles merged sets recursively)
- Added preload bindings for all card sets APIs

**Pipeline Integration:**
- Updated Leo prompt to generate suggested_set_name and suggested_set_description
- Added set name fields to LeoContext interface
- Conviction phase now creates CardSet record with all minted card IDs
- Each card-index entry now includes setId reference
- Pipeline state includes createdSetId and createdSetName
- "View Set in Library" button navigates with ?setId= filter param

**Card Library UI:**
- Added useSearchParams for reading URL query params
- Added state for cardSets, activeSetId, activeSetCardIds
- Added useEffects to load card sets and handle URL params
- Added set filter to filteredCards useMemo (includes child cards)
- Added "Active Set Filter Indicator" bar showing current set with clear button
- Added "Card Sets Selector" row showing recent sets as clickable chips

**Files Created:**
- docs/card_sets_feature_design.md - Comprehensive design document
- src/types/cardSet.ts - TypeScript interfaces

**Files Modified:**
- electron/main.ts - Added Card Sets IPC handlers
- electron/preload.ts - Added Card Sets API bindings
- electron/pipeline.ts - Updated Leo prompt, Conviction phase, state
- electron/cardManager.ts - Added set name fields to LeoContext
- src/pages/Pipeline.tsx - Phase progress bar, clearer buttons, set info
- src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx - Set filtering and UI

**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 5 hours

## Entry 14 - Card Inspector Image Gen Fix + Loop Video Error Handling
**Prompt:** Fix Card Inspector "Create Image" button (quota error) and fix loop video broadcast errors

**Summary of actions:**

### Card Inspector Image Generation Fix
- **Issue:** Card Inspector was hitting Imagen 4 quota limits (429 errors)
- **Root Cause:** `common-image` shorthand was changed to map to `imagen-4.0-generate-001` instead of `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- **Fix:** Updated `MODEL_SHORTHAND_MAP` in `electron/vertexai.ts`:
  - `common-image` → `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (no quota limits)
  - Added `gemini-image` alias for Gemini-based image generation
- **Result:** Card Inspector uses Gemini Flash (fast, no quota), Hell Week uses Imagen 4 (high quality)

### Loop Video Broadcast Error Fix
- **Issue:** Console spam with "Render frame was disposed" errors when navigating away during video generation
- **Root Cause:** `broadcastLoopProgress` trying to send to disposed window
- **Fix:** Added safety checks to `broadcastLoopProgress` function:
  - `!mainWin.isDestroyed()` check
  - `!mainWin.webContents.isDestroyed()` check
  - Try-catch wrapper for edge cases

**Files Modified:**
- electron/vertexai.ts - Fixed model mapping for common-image
- electron/main.ts - Added safety checks to broadcastLoopProgress

**Tags:** #bugfix #image-gen #loop-video #error-handling
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 20 minutes

## Entry 15 - Set Cards Architecture Planning
**Prompt:** Upgrade Sets from loose abstraction to actual cards with media, skills, and self-contained data model

**Summary of actions:**

### Analysis of Current Architecture
- **Problem:** Card-to-set relationships managed by centralized index
- **Issue 1:** If card-sets-index is lost, set metadata is lost
- **Issue 2:** Cards only store singular `setId` - can't belong to multiple sets
- **Issue 3:** Sets are NOT cards - no media, XP, skills, can't display in library
- **Rebuild-ability:** Requires both indexes intact (fragile)

### Target Architecture: Self-Contained Model
**Key Principle:** Each hypercore should know its full state for rebuild-ability

**New Data Model:**
- All cards get `memberOfSets[]` array (not singular setId)
- Set Cards get `containedCards[]` array
- Dual-write protocol: both sides updated when adding/removing

**Set Card Type:**
- `cardType: "set"` - distinguishes from standard cards
- Has media (cover image), tier, XP, level like other cards
- **Skills:**
  - `Contain` (passive) - holds and organizes cards, +10% XP bonus
  - `Consume` (active) - add card to set via drag or button

### Rebuild Test
If we lose all indexes but have individual hypercores:
1. Read all card hypercores
2. Cards with `cardType: "set"` → reconstruct sets
3. Cards with `memberOfSets[]` → validate/repair memberships
4. Full graph reconstructable from primitives

**Planning Doc Created:** `docs/set_cards_architecture_plan.md`

**Tags:** #architecture #card-sets #self-contained #rebuild-ability #planning
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 1 hour (planning only)

## Entry 16 - Set Cards Implementation (Phases 1-3)
**Prompt:** Implement Set Cards as real cards with self-contained relationships

**Summary of actions:**

### Phase 1: Types & Interfaces (`src/types/cardSet.ts`)
- Added `CardType`, `SkillType`, `MediaKind` enums
- Created `SetMembership` (cards → sets) and `ContainedCard` (sets → cards)
- Created `Skill` and `SkillEffect` interfaces with defaults for Contain/Consume
- Created `BaseCard`, `StandardCard`, `SetCard`, `MergedSetCard` interfaces
- Created `CardIndexEntry` with all new fields
- Added factory functions: `createSetCard()`, `migrateCardSetToSetCard()`

### Phase 2: Pipeline Update (`electron/pipeline.ts`)
- Standard cards now include `cardType: 'standard'` and `memberOfSets[]`
- Set Cards created as real card-index entries with:
  - `cardType: 'set'`
  - `containedCards[]` with all member references
  - `skills[]` (Contain, Consume)
  - `containedCardCount`
- Dual-write: Both card-library (new) and card-sets (legacy)

### Phase 3: Frontend Display (`src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx`, `src/utils/cardQuality.ts`)
- Updated `CardIndexEntry` interface with new fields
- Set Cards render with distinct amber glow and border
- "📦 SET CARD" badge on quality bar
- Contained cards count badge (folder icon)
- Added 'set' to `CardType` for type filtering
- Updated `getCardType()` to detect Set Cards

**Files Modified:**
- src/types/cardSet.ts - Complete rewrite with self-contained model
- electron/pipeline.ts - Updated Conviction phase for Set Cards
- src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx - Set Card visual rendering
- src/utils/cardQuality.ts - Added 'set' card type
- docs/set_cards_architecture_plan.md - Updated with progress

## Entry 17 - Card Inspector Bug Fixes
**Prompt:** Fix 4 issues: Create Image fails, Create Loop Video fails, missing parent, missing Hell Week data

**Summary of actions:**

### Issue 1: "Create Image" Button Fails - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Card Inspector was calling `generateImageGemini()` with Gemini Flash model, but Gemini Flash CANNOT generate images - it can only analyze them.
**Fix:** Changed to `generateImageImagen()` with `pro-image` (Imagen 4) - same as Hell Week pipeline.

### Issue 2: "Create Loop Video" Button - INVESTIGATING
Frontend code looks correct. May need further investigation into path resolution.

### Issue 3: Hell Week Cards Missing Parent - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Pipeline didn't set `parentCardId` on standard cards.
**Fix:** Added `parentCardId: setCardId` to card index entries in pipeline.

### Issue 4: Hell Week Data Not Displayed - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Two problems:
1. Pipeline wasn't including `cardData` (skills, lore, stats) in card index
2. Frontend wasn't extracting new fields from card index

**Fixes:**
1. Pipeline now includes full `cardData` and `mediaPrompts`
2. Frontend `loadCards()` extracts all new fields (cardType, parentCardId, etc.)
3. Frontend `enrichWithCardRecords()` merges index data with hypercore data

**Files Modified:**
- electron/main.ts - Use Imagen 4 for image generation
- electron/pipeline.ts - Add parentCardId, cardData, mediaPrompts to card index
- src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx - Extract and merge new fields

**Planning Doc:** `docs/card_inspector_fixes.md`

**Tags:** #bugfix #card-inspector #image-generation #hell-week
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 1.5 hours

## Entry 18 - Loop Video Storage Fix & Retroactive Parent Repair
**Prompt:** Fix hero image not showing video behind it; fix "No Parent" for Hell Week cards retroactively

**Summary of actions:**

### Issue 1: Loop Video Not Showing Behind Hero Image - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Loop video children were written to a hypercore named after the card's ID, but Hell Week cards are read from the `card-library` index, not individual hypercores.

**Fix:** Updated `create-loop-video-for-image` handler to write children to the `card-library` index entry in addition to the individual hypercore. This ensures Hell Week cards (which don't have individual hypercores) properly display their loop videos.

### Issue 2: Retroactive Parent Fix - ADDED
**Feature:** Added `repair-hell-week-parents` IPC handler that:
1. Scans all cards in card-library
2. Finds cards with `setId` but no `parentCardId`
3. Sets `parentCardId = setId` and adds `memberOfSets[]`
4. Appends corrected entries to card-library

**Usage:** Click "Recover" button in Card Library (now runs both orphan recovery AND parent repair).

**Files Modified:**
- electron/main.ts - Loop video writes to card-library index; Added repair IPC handler
- electron/preload.ts - Exposed `repairHellWeekParents`
- src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx - Recover button now runs repair

**Tags:** #bugfix #loop-video #hell-week #parent-repair #retroactive
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 1 hour

## Entry 20 - Card Inspector Hell Week Data Fix
**Prompt:** Missing Lore data in card inspector for Hell Week cards

**Summary of actions:**

### Root Cause Analysis
The Card Inspector was looking for Hell Week fields at wrong paths:
- **Expected:** `rec.cardData?.lore`, `rec.cardData?.skills`, etc.
- **Actual:** Data is at `rec.lore`, `rec.skills`, etc. (not nested)

This happened because:
1. Pipeline stores: `cardData: { lore, skills, stats, ... }`
2. loadCards extracts: `cardRecord = data.cardData` (unwraps the nesting)
3. Merge logic preserves flat structure
4. Display code was looking for nested `.cardData?.X` ❌

### Fixes Applied

**1. Fixed incorrect path references (6 locations):**
- `rec.cardData?.lore` → `rec.lore`
- `rec.cardData?.skills` → `rec.skills`
- `rec.cardData?.stats?.type` → `rec.stats?.type`
- `rec.cardData?.name` → `rec.name`
- `isHellWeekCard()` check updated

**2. Enhanced merge logic to include all Hell Week fields:**
- `name`, `lore`, `skills`, `stats`, `abilities`
- `flavor_text`, `type`, `element`, `rarity`
- `mediaPrompts`, `truthAnalysis`

**3. Added new display sections:**
- **Flavor Text** - Italic quote with violet accent
- **Classification** - Type, Element, Rarity badges
- **Abilities** - List with rose accent

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/CardLibrary.tsx`
  - Fixed 6 path references from `rec.cardData?.X` to `rec.X`
  - Enhanced merge logic with additional fields
  - Added Flavor Text, Classification, Abilities sections

## Entry 21 - Persistence Layer Foundation (SQLite Projection Engine)
**Prompt:** Review memory-notes-12-6-2025.md and implement the proposed persistence layer

**Summary of actions:**

### Context
The app uses Hypercore as source of truth, but needs a fast local query layer for:
- Full-text search
- Semantic/vector search (future)
- Graph traversals (wiki relationships)
- RAG context for agents

### Solution: SQLite Projection Layer
Implemented a rebuildable SQLite cache that mirrors Hypercore data.

### Files Created

**1. `src/persistence/types.ts`** - Shared types
- Search/filter interfaces
- Result types (CardSearchResult, RagChunk, GraphNeighbor)
- Event types for projection pipeline
- Card/Wiki payloads

**2. `src/persistence/PersistenceAdapter.ts`** - Interface
- Lifecycle: initialize, close, isReady
- Events: applyEvent, applyEvents
- Queries: searchCards, getRagContext, getGraphNeighbors
- Maintenance: getProjectionVersion, clearAndRebuild, getStats

**3. `electron/persistence-types.ts`** - Electron-side types copy

**4. `electron/SqliteAdapter.ts`** - Full implementation
- Schema: cards, card_fts (FTS5), wiki_nodes, wiki_edges, embeddings, projection_meta
- Event handlers: CARD_CREATED, CARD_UPDATED, WIKI_NODE_CREATED, WIKI_EDGE_CREATED
- Search: FTS with filters, filter-only queries
- RAG: FTS-based context retrieval (vector search deferred)
- Graph: BFS neighbor traversal
- Maintenance: version checking, stats, rebuild support

**5. `src/persistence/index.ts`** - Exports

**6. `docs/PERSISTENCE_LAYER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** - Implementation plan

```

### Wiring (Steps 3 & 4 - COMPLETE)

**In `electron/main.ts`:**
- Added `SqliteAdapter` import
- Added `persistenceAdapter` global instance
- Added `initPersistence()` function - called after `initP2P()`
- Added `emitCardEvent()` helper - fires projection events
- Added `getPersistence()` accessor
- Hooked `emitCardEvent` into:
  - Wormhole card creation
  - Loop video card creation
- Added IPC handlers:
  - `persistence:search-cards`
  - `persistence:get-rag-context`

const results = await window.electronAPI.persistenceSearchCards({
  text: 'hypercore wormhole',
  filters: { cardType: 'standard', minTier: 2 },
  limit: 20,
});

// Get stats
const stats = await window.electronAPI.persistenceGetStats();
console.log('Cards indexed:', stats.cardCount);
```

## Entry 22 - Persistence Layer: Additional Event Hooks
**Prompt:** Continue implementation of persistence layer

**Summary of actions:**

### Created Shared Persistence Module
Created `electron/persistence.ts` as a singleton module that can be imported by any electron-side module (main.ts, pipeline.ts, etc.) without circular dependencies.

**Exports:**
- `initPersistence()` - Initialize once
- `getPersistence()` - Get adapter instance
- `isPersistenceReady()` - Check ready state
- `emitCardEvent()` - Emit single card event
- `emitCardEvents()` - Emit batch of events (efficient for pipelines)

### Added Event Hooks

**Hell Week Pipeline (`electron/pipeline.ts`):**
- Batch emit all cards after Conviction phase
- Emit set card after creation
- Uses `emitCardEvents()` for efficiency

**Agent Profile (`electron/main.ts`):**
- Emit when profile image card is created

### Files Modified
- `electron/main.ts` - Use shared persistence module
- `electron/pipeline.ts` - Add batch event emission
- `electron/persistence.ts` - NEW: Shared singleton module
- `docs/PERSISTENCE_LAYER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Updated status

## Entry 23 - Modern Mermaid Integration
**Prompt:** Integrate gotoailab/modern_mermaid as a new sub-app

**Summary of actions:**

### Review
Analyzed Modern Mermaid repo - a Mermaid.js diagram editor with live preview, themes, and export. Compatible tech stack (React, TS, Vite, Tailwind).

### Implementation
Created `src/pages/Mermaid.tsx` with:
- Split-pane editor (code left, preview right)
- Live preview with 300ms debounce
- 8 sample diagram templates (flowchart, sequence, class, state, ER, Gantt, mindmap, pie)
- 5 Mermaid themes (default, dark, forest, neutral, base)
- PNG export at 3x resolution
- Copy to clipboard
- Fullscreen mode
- Syntax error display
- Status bar with stats
- Link to Mermaid docs

### Routing
- Added route `/mermaid` in `src/App.tsx`
- Added nav item "Diagrams" with `schema` icon after "Wiki" in `src/components/Layout.tsx`

### Dependencies Added
```bash
npm install mermaid html-to-image lucide-react
```

### Files Changed
- `src/pages/Mermaid.tsx` - NEW
- `src/App.tsx` - Added import and route
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Added nav item
- `docs/MODERN_MERMAID_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - NEW

### Future Enhancements
- Save diagrams to Hypercore

**Tags:** #feature #mermaid #diagrams #integration
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 1.5 hours

## Entry 24 - Validation Protocol & Icon Fix
**Prompt:** Fix missing Diagrams icon; establish validation protocol for future work

**Summary of actions:**

### The Problem
Used web search to find Astro UXDS icons. Search results said "extends Material Design icons." Assumed `schema`, `account-tree`, `insights` would work. None did.

### Root Cause
Relied on secondary sources (web search) instead of primary source (Astro UXDS Icon Library page). Web search rankings are profit-optimized, not truth-optimized.

### Resolution
- Found `timeline` works by trial
- Created `docs/VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md` - permanent reference on source validation
- Created memory entries for future sessions

### Key Lesson
The cost of NOT validating fully >> cost of taking time to verify. Multiple correction cycles waste more time than upfront validation from the primary source.

### Validation Hierarchy Established
1. Official documentation from creators (HIGH)
2. Source code / repository (HIGH)
3. Working examples in codebase (MEDIUM-HIGH)
4. Web search / Stack Overflow (LOW - requires verification)

### Files Changed
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Fixed icon to `timeline`
- `docs/VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md` - NEW

**Tags:** #protocol #validation #epistemology #partnership #lesson-learned
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 0.5 hours

## Entry 25 - Library Overhaul: Lineage Badges & The Hand
**Prompt:** Implement a light-to-medium library overhaul with abstraction layers, lineage badges (ancestors/descendants), card physics, and a persistent "Hand" feature.

**Summary of actions:**

### Research Phase
Studied card game library patterns from MTG Arena, Hearthstone, Slay the Spire, Genshin Impact, Pokemon TCG, and Balatro. Key insights:
- Stacks > Lists for visual organization
- Lineage = Power (ancestry as power metric)
- Physics = Satisfaction (card movement with tilt/shadow)
- Hand = Agency (persistent card collection across UI)

### Design Document Created
`docs/LIBRARY_OVERHAUL_DESIGN.md` - Comprehensive 300+ line design document covering:
- Abstraction layers (By Set, By Rarity, Recent, Hot)
- Deck Stack component design
- Lineage badge specifications
- Card physics drag system
- The Hand persistent dock
- Technical architecture
- Implementation phases

### Phase 1: Lineage Badges ✅ COMPLETE
- `src/utils/cardLineage.ts` - Utility for calculating ancestors/descendants
- `src/components/cards/LineageBadge.tsx` - Visual badge components
- Integrated into CardLibrary.tsx card grid (corners layout)
- Blue badges for ancestors (⬆), orange for descendants (⬇)

### Phase 3: The Hand ✅ COMPLETE
- `src/contexts/HandContext.tsx` - Global state with localStorage persistence
- `src/components/cards/CardHand.tsx` - Visual dock at bottom of screen
- Added HandProvider to App.tsx
- Added CardHand to Layout.tsx
- Cards can be dragged from library to hand
- Fan display with hover effects
- Collapse/expand functionality
- "In Hand" indicator on cards in grid

### CSS Animations Added
- Card lift/drop animations
- Hand expand/collapse
- Lineage badge pulse
- Drag ghost trail
- In-hand indicator pulse

### Files Created

**Tags:** #feature #library #cards #hand #lineage #RPG #design
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 4-5 hours

## Entry 26 - The Hand v2: Light Deck Redesign
**Prompt:** Redesign the Hand to be top-right, minimal footprint, neon light outlines with state-based color coding (Thor=red, Leo=blue, Conviction=green, Run=purple, Processing=yellow).

**Summary of actions:**

### Problems with v1
- Bottom position took too much visual space (giant grey bar)
- Felt clunky and disconnected from the futuristic UI aesthetic
- No state communication about what a card is doing

### Design Philosophy v2
Blend the "Futuristic Light Interface" aesthetic with soft tactile card game feel:
- **Position**: Top-right corner (minimal footprint)
- **Style**: Neon outline glow, no heavy background
- **State Colors**: Border/glow changes based on card assignment:
  - Cyan (idle) - default, in hand
  - Red (thor) - assigned to Thor processing
  - Blue (leo) - assigned to Leo processing  
  - Green (conviction) - Conviction system
  - Purple (run) - attached to active run
  - Yellow (processing) - currently being processed
- **Interaction**: Cards lift and scale on hover, show tooltip with state

### Sway Animation Tweak
- **Feedback**: User requested to "kill the motion" temporarily to evaluate the neon pulse in isolation.
- **Action**: Commented out `bob` and `tilt` animations in `FloatingCard.tsx`.
- **Status**: Pulse is active, movement is static.

### Refined Sway Animation
- **Feedback**: Original sway was "turning and dropping and then restarting," feeling robotic.
- **Fix**: Split sway into two independent, desynchronized loops (`bob` and `tilt`) using `alternate: true` in Anime.js v4.
- **Result**: Smooth, continuous organic hovering without jumpy resets.

### Files Modified
- `src/components/cards/FloatingCard.tsx` - Complete rewrite with physics loop.
- `src/components/cards/CardHand.tsx` - Complete redesign with:
  - Top-right fixed position
  - Tiny collapsed pill (just card icon + count)
  - Expanded horizontal row of mini cards (40x56px)
  - Neon border/glow based on state
  - State indicator dot on cards
  - Hover lift + tooltip with card name + state label
- `src/contexts/HandContext.tsx` - Added:
  - `CardState` type export
  - `state` field on `HandCard`
  - `setCardState()` and `getCardState()` functions
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Removed bottom padding
- `src/index.css` - Added hand card animations

### State Scaffolding Ready For
When Thor/Leo/Conviction/Run systems are enhanced:
```typescript
const { setCardState } = useHand();
setCardState(cardId, 'thor');  // Card glows red, pulses
setCardState(cardId, 'run');   // Card glows purple, pulses
```

**Tags:** #feature #hand #redesign #UI #states #neon
**Est. Avg. Human Dev Time:** 1.5 hours

## Entry 27 - Anime.js Animation System Integration
**Prompt:** Install anime.js, create animation reference docs, and implement card/hand animations for the gacha/RPG/loot card aesthetic.

**Summary of actions:**

### Phase 1: Research & Documentation
- Installed `animejs@4.2.2` and `@types/animejs`
- Studied anime.js v4 API (significantly different from v3)
- Created comprehensive guide: `docs/ANIME_ANIMATION_GUIDE.md`
- Created memory reference for quick lookup

### Phase 2: Animation Hooks (`src/hooks/useAnime.ts`)
Created reusable animation utilities:
- **`staggerPresets`**: cascade, ripple, random, reverse
- **`animateCardState()`**: State-based glow (Thor=red, Leo=blue, etc.)
- **`useCardHover()`**: Lift + shadow effect on hover
- **`useStaggeredReveal()`**: Grid cards animate in with cascade
- **`animateCardPulse()`**: Click confirmation pulse
- **`animateCardAddToHand()`**: Spring pop-in animation
- **`animateCardRemoveFromHand()`**: Shrink + fade out
- **`animateInspectorOpen/Close()`**: Slide transitions
- **`animateRarityGlow()`**: Tier-based glow (Common→Mythic)
- **`createScanEffect()`**: Yellow scan line for processing
- **`animateArcFlight()`**: Card-to-hand arc trajectory
- **`useAnimationCleanup()`**: Auto-pause on unmount

### Phase 3: Integration
**CardHand.tsx:**
- Added refs for all card elements
- `useEffect` triggers `animateCardAddToHand` when cards added
- `useEffect` triggers `animateCardState` when state changes
- Animation cleanup on unmount

**CardLibrary.tsx:**
- Added `cardGridRef` for grid container
- `useStaggeredReveal` animates cards when filter/sort changes
- Cards fade in with scale + translateY cascade

### Animation Design Philosophy
1. **Anticipation → Action → Follow-through**: Every motion has weight
2. **Stagger Everything**: Grids never pop in all at once
3. **Spring Physics**: Cards feel "grabbed" and "snapped"
4. **Neon Glow as Feedback**: State communicated through light
5. **Z-Depth Through Motion**: Scale + shadow imply 3D space

### Color-Coded States
| State | Color | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|

## Entry 30 - Progressive Card Loading Architecture
**Prompt:** Re-architect card library for async queue loading with per-card animations.

**Problem:** Loading 100+ cards at once with animations was crashing the UI.

**Solution:** Progressive loading system with virtual scrolling.

### Architecture Created

**New Files:**
- `docs/CARD_LIBRARY_ASYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Full design doc
- `src/hooks/useCardLoadQueue.ts` - Progressive loading hook
- `src/components/cards/VirtualCardGrid.tsx` - Virtual scroll + reveal wrapper

**Key Concepts:**

1. **One Card Animates at a Time**
   - Queue system processes reveals sequentially
   - No concurrent animation bombs

2. **Rarity-Based Reveal Animations**
   | Tier | Animation | Duration |
   |------|-----------|----------|
   | Common | fade | 200ms |
   | Uncommon | slide-up | 300ms |
   | Rare | scale-pop | 350ms |
   | Epic | glitch | 450ms |
   | Legendary | golden-burst | 550ms |
   | Mythic | rainbow-spiral | 700ms |

3. **Virtual Scrolling**
   - Only render viewport + buffer (~40 cards max)
   - Skeleton placeholders outside visible range
   - Pause reveals during scroll

4. **Load Queue Contract**
   ```
   skeleton → fetching → revealing → ready
   ```

### CSS Animations Added
- `.reveal-fade` - Simple opacity fade
- `.reveal-slide-up` - Slide up + fade
- `.reveal-scale-pop` - Bounce scale
- `.reveal-glitch` - Glitch flicker effect
- `.reveal-golden-burst` - Gold particle burst
- `.reveal-rainbow-spiral` - Rainbow hue rotation

### Performance Targets
- Initial load: <500ms to first card (was 3-5s crash)
- Max DOM cards: 40 (was 100+)
- Max concurrent animations: 1 reveal (was 100+)
- Target FPS: 60 during scroll

**Status:** Architecture complete, integration pending.

## Entry 31 - Hand Display Fix & Tactile Drag Animations
**Prompt:** Fix hand card display limit and add satisfying drag animations.

**Summary of actions:**

### Hand Display Fix
The hand was cutting off cards after 3 due to no `flex-wrap` on the card container.

**Fix:**
```jsx
// Before: Cards overflow off-screen
<div className="flex items-center gap-1">

// After: Cards wrap into grid
<div className="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-1.5 max-w-[280px]">
```

- Increased card size from `w-10 h-14` to `w-12 h-16`
- Added `flex-wrap` for multiple rows
- Set `max-w-[280px]` to constrain width
- Updated empty slot to match new card size

### Tactile Drag Animations
Added CSS animations for satisfying card pickup and movement.

**New CSS Classes:**
| Class | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `.card-pickup` | Scale + rotate on grab (200ms) |
| `.card-dragging-active` | Lift, tilt, cyan glow while dragging |
| `.card-drop-hand` | Celebratory bounce on drop |
| `.drop-zone-active` | Pulsing glow on drop targets |
| `.card-shake` | Shake on invalid drop |
| `.hand-card-attract` | Magnetic bobbing near hand |

**Animation Sequence (Drag to Hand):**
1. Pick up card → `.card-pickup` (scale 1.15, rotate -3°)
2. While dragging → `.card-dragging-active` (tilt, shadow, cyan ring)
3. Drop on hand → `.card-drop-hand` (bounce scale 1.2 → 0.9 → 1)
4. Settle → Normal display

### Files Modified
- `src/components/cards/CardHand.tsx` - Flex wrap, larger cards, drag handlers
- `src/components/cards/VirtualCardGrid.tsx` - Drag animations on grid cards
- `src/index.css` - All tactile animation keyframes

## 32. The "Ghost Card" Exorcism & V2 Drag System
**Date**: Dec 7, 2025
**Time**: 03:50 UTC
**Goal**: Implement smooth, physics-based card dragging in the Hand component without the native HTML5 "ghost" effect and with robust drop zone detection.

### The Problem
Initial attempts using Anime.js `createDraggable` or simple pointer events failed to suppress the browser's native drag-and-drop behavior, resulting in a "ghost" image. Additionally, layout stacking contexts caused `position: fixed` elements to be clipped or positioned incorrectly relative to the viewport.

### The Solution: "Clone & Portal" Pointer System (V2)
1. **Refactored `useDraggableCards` (V2)**:
   - **Cloning**: Instead of moving the original element (which causes layout jumps and clipping), we clone it and append to `document.body`.
   - **Portal**: The clone is `position: fixed` relative to the viewport, bypassing stacking contexts and `overflow: hidden`.
   - **Original Element**: Hidden (`opacity: 0`) but stays in layout flow.
2. **Explicit Props**:
   - `onPointerDown`: Captures pointer, creates clone, handles animation.
   - `onDragStart`: **Hard return false** and `preventDefault()` to kill native drag.
3. **Drop Zone Integration**:
   - Added `onDragEnter` and `onDragLeave` callbacks to the hook.
   - `CardHand` uses these to toggle its visual state (cyan border/pulse), unifying the visual feedback loop.
4. **CSS Reinforcement**: Added `.hand-card-draggable` with `touch-action: none` and `user-select: none`.

### Outcome
Cards now:
- Pop up (scale 1.1x) immediately on press as a high-z-index clone.
- Float above ALL UI elements (no clipping).
- Trigger drop zone highlights reliably via geometry checks.
- Snap back beautifully if dropped invalidly.
- Zero "ghosting" artifacts.

### 33. The Global Drag Canvas (V3: Anime.js Integration)
**Date**: Dec 7, 2025
**Time**: 04:30 UTC
**Goal**: Implement the "Transport Up" mechanic using **Anime.js `createDraggable`** as explicitly requested, ensuring robust physics and z-index safety.

### The Strategy
The previous custom pointer implementation solved the ghosting but missed the specific "feel" of Anime.js. V3 combines the "Global Canvas" architecture with actual Anime.js instances.

### Implementation
1.  **`DragCanvasContext`**: Now manages a persistent list of `floatingItems` (supporting "leave it there").
2.  **`FloatingCard`**: A new component rendered on the top-level canvas that initializes `createDraggable` on itself. This creates a self-contained physics entity.
3.  **`DraggableHandCard`**: When clicked/dragged, it spawns a `FloatingCard` at its exact position and hides itself.
4.  **`createDraggable` Restored**: Re-exported from `useAnime` to power the floating cards.

### Outcome
- **Transport**: Click/Drag instantly lifts the card to the global layer.
- **Physics**: Anime.js handles the drag (elasticity, momentum).
- **Persistence**: Dropped cards stay on the canvas (until we implement specific drop logic to return them).
- **No Ghost**: Native drag is explicitly prevented on the floating elements.

### Files Created
- `src/contexts/DragCanvasContext.tsx`
- `src/components/DragCanvas.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useGlobalDrag.ts`
- `src/components/cards/DraggableHandCard.tsx`
- `src/components/cards/FloatingCard.tsx`

### Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx` (Provider wrap)
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` (Canvas mount)
- `src/components/cards/CardHand.tsx` (Refactor to use new system)
- `src/hooks/useAnime.ts` (Restore export)

## 34. Disable Hand Drop Zone
**Date**: Dec 7, 2025
**Time**: 04:40 UTC
**Goal**: Temporarily disable the Card Hand drop zone functionality to isolate drag behavior and prevent unwanted snapping/visuals.

### Execution
- Commented out `data-hand-container` attribute in `CardHand.tsx`.
- This effectively disables the drop target detection for the custom drag system.

## 35. Extend Anime.js Drag to Library Grid
**Date**: Dec 7, 2025
**Time**: 04:50 UTC
**Goal**: Fulfill user request to apply the "Transport & Drag" (Anime.js) system to the main `CardLibrary` grid, replacing the native drag (and its annoying ghost/drop-zone side effects).

### Implementation
1.  **Created `DraggableGridCard`**: A wrapper component similar to `DraggableHandCard` but designed for the virtual grid context.
2.  **Refactored `VirtualCardGrid`**:
    - Removed `draggable="true"` and native `onDragStart` handlers.
    - Wrapped card rendering with `DraggableGridCard`.
    - Uses `useGlobalDrag` to spawn `FloatingCard` clones on the canvas.

### Outcome
- **Unified Experience**: Both Hand and Library cards now use the same high-performance Anime.js drag system.
- **No Native Conflict**: Native drag events are suppressed, preventing the "Drop Zone" overlay from appearing.
- **Visuals**: Grid cards are cloned to the canvas when interacted with, leaving the original in place (standard library behavior) while allowing the user to drag the copy anywhere.

## 36. Final Polish of Anime.js Drag System
**Date**: Dec 7, 2025
**Time**: 04:55 UTC
**Goal**: Resolve remaining visibility and interaction issues with the new drag system.

### Debugging Findings
1.  **Invisible Clones**: The `DragCanvas` component was not mounted in `Layout.tsx`, meaning the context state was updating but nothing was rendering.
2.  **Broken Interactions**: `useGlobalDrag` was capturing `pointerdown` and preventing default, killing native `onClick` handlers.
3.  **Disappearing Hand Cards**: Due to #2, clicking a card spawned a clone (hiding the original) but failed to trigger the selection logic, leaving the UI in a "stuck" hidden state.

### Fixes
- Mounted `<DragCanvas />` in `Layout.tsx` (z-index 99999).
- Implemented **Pointer Capture** in `FloatingCard` for seamless drag transfer.
- Added `onClick` support to `DragItem` / `useGlobalDrag` to restore "Click to Inspect" functionality.
- Updated `DraggableHandCard` and `DraggableGridCard` to pass click handlers through the drag system.

### Outcome
- **Perfect Drag**: Cards pop from grid/hand and follow mouse instantly.
- **Perfect Click**: Clicking without dragging triggers inspection/selection as expected.
- **No Ghosts**: Native drag is dead. Long live Anime.js.

## Entry 37 – Thor's Hamma Terminal Logs & Bug Fixes
**Date**: Dec 8, 2025
**Prompt:** "Can you put the terminal updates for the entire pipeline in the terminal view in the UI? It's really engaging to see it in the terminal, but for the user there's no updates for a long time..."

**Summary of actions:**
1. **Fixed IPC Communication**: Backend was sending IPC via `webContents.send()` but frontend was listening for DOM events. Added `onThorUpdate` listener in `electron/preload.ts` to bridge IPC to renderer.
2. **Fixed Card Fabrication**: Cards were being saved to a custom core instead of `card-library`. Updated `fabricateAssets()` to use proper `card-index` format and emit to persistence layer.
3. **Added Emojis**: 🐱 for Thor (cat) and 🐕 for Leo (dog) in log messages, both in backend output and frontend display.
4. **Added Completion Logs**: Leo now logs when analysis is complete, Thor logs when synthesis is complete and when each card is forged.
5. **Fixed Syntax Error**: Repaired `main.ts` structure by adding missing `createWindow()` closure and `app.on('ready')` wrapper.

**Files Modified:**
- `electron/thors-hamma.ts` - Card library integration, emojis, completion logs
- `electron/preload.ts` - Added `onThorUpdate` IPC listener
- `src/pages/ThorsHamma.tsx` - Proper IPC callback usage, emoji display
- `src/types.d.ts` - Added `onThorUpdate` type
- `docs/THORS_HAMMA_PROGRESS.md` - Updated with fix details
